# The half of the nightly `stream-health.yml` that a GitHub runner cannot answer: does a track
# still resolve to a URL that serves the whole file, and is rustypipe's fallback URL fetchable.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT IN CI: YouTube answers `/player` from an Actions runner with UNPLAYABLE "Sign in
# to confirm you're not a bot", and rustypipe's resolve with the same sentence, because those
# runners sit in Azure ranges. The runner bootstraps a valid visitorData and is refused anyway, so
# no amount of session work fixes it. A home connection gets the real answer, which is also the
# answer the users get. The other four live tests are IP-agnostic and stay in the workflow.
#
#   scripts/stream-health-local.sh            # run once, notify only if something broke
#   scripts/stream-health-local.sh --install  # set up the daily systemd user timer
#   systemctl --user list-timers limusic-stream-health.timer
#
# Full output of the last run is kept at ~/.local/state/limusic/stream-health.log.
#
# ponytail: a timer and notify-send, no alerting stack. It runs on the machine that would ship the
# fix anyway. If this ever needs to reach you when you are away from it, the lazy upgrade is a
# `gh issue create` in the red branch, not a service.
